# Overview

This chapter will cover the component model of mvui. We will discuss component definition,
rendering lifecycle, props, attributes, styling, events and slots.

We will also discuss the very basics of reactivity to get you started, but since this is a
rather complex topic, reactivity will be covered more in depth in [its own
chapter](/docs/reactivity/overview/).
